# Stock Market Price Prediction üìà

This project presents a **Stock Market Price Prediction** model using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. The goal is to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, leveraging time series analysis and regression models.

üìÇ Project Overview

The core of this project is an interactive Jupyter Notebook:
- `Stock_Market_Price_Prediction_.ipynb` ‚Äì Contains data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Market_Price_Prediction_.ipynb
   ```

 Output

The notebook includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmaps
- Linear Regression modeling
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics

 Notes

- The model is built on sample stock data and can be adapted to other stock datasets with similar structures.
- Further enhancements may include LSTM models, real-time prediction integration, and deployment.
